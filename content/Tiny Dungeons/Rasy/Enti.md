Treefolk are massive, lumbering beasts, akin to living trees. They
tend to live very long lives—hundreds of years—and have a
reputation for being wise and learned. They are solitary creatures,
preferring to live alone, even from their own kind, keeping to the
forests they tend and grow.
Treefolk are huge, standing close to 12 feet tall. They look
like mobile trees, long bark covered bodies striding through the
woods, as their crown of leaves reaches to the skies.
