Dwarves are stocky and gruff creatures that hail from magnificent
cities hewn into mountains. They pride themselves on their drinking,
craftsmanship, and fighting prowess. Dwarven society is heavily
influenced by a strong sense of honor and justice. Because of this,
they are viewed as being trustworthy individuals, but also stubborn
and set in their ways.
On average, both male and
female dwarves stand 4 feet tall,
and have broad, muscular bodies.
It is highly suspect to find an
adult male dwarf without a long,
braided beard. Beard growth is a
rite of passage for dwarven men,
and once they start growing their
beard, they never shave it off.
