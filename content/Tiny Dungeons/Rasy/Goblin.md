Goblins are a diminutive, green-skinned people that eke out
a living wherever they can—usually living in small tribes or as
solitary individuals. Their behavior, even in adulthood, is childlike.
They are inquisitive by nature and somewhat mischievous,
although their antics are rarely malicious. Goblins are also easily
distracted by shiny objects, and they have a particular affection
for gold.
Standing just over 3 feet tall, goblins are on average very
scrawny and have wide, oblong heads with protruding, bat-like
ears. They are notoriously quick, and due to their compulsive
fascination with gold, they have gained notoriety
as being thieves. Despite their appearance
and impish nature, goblins are usually goodnatured
creatures that enjoy the company of
anyone who can tolerate them.
