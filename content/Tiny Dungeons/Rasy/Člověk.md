Humans are the most prolific Heritage due to their extreme
adaptability and determination. Humans are capable of living in
punishing conditions, from icy tundra to blistering deserts. They can
produce glorious cities or live simple lives as nomads.
Humans are just as varied as the places where you find them. They
come in all shapes and sizes and temperaments. On average, they
are between 5 and 6 feet tall, with males tending to be taller than
females.
