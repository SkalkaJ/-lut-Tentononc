Known as elves to humans, Fey build their cities secluded deep
within forests. They are renowned for their talent with archery,
which they use to deadly effect to protect their territories, while
remaining hidden in the treetops. They are by nature a secretive
people, and it can be difficult to earn their trust.
Fey are slightly shorter than the average human, with slender,
graceful frames and elongated ears that taper to a point. They have a
tendency to be androgynous in appearance and are considered to be
incredibly beautiful even by members of other Heritages.
