Cold-blooded, cruel, and primitive, Lizardfolk are the remains of a
servant Heritage created by wizards. Strong, violent, and territorial,
Lizardfolk stalk the swamps and jungles of the world, carving
out their fate by tooth, claw and spiked club. Most Lizardfolk
adventurers start as outcasts or raiders, and eventually grow into
something more, becoming heroes and legends of the Lizardfolk
back home. They make implacable allies and relentless foes.
Lizardfolks are scaled, with a muted assortment of colors (the
better to lurk and blend into the swamps they call home.) Many
have a ridge of fins or spikes along their spine, and some webbing
in their clawed feet and hands.
