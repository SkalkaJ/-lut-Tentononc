Název -> Čapkovo mloci
Salimar have earned a reputation for being hard-nosed, but
fair merchants, living by waterways and port cities to conduct
business. They are highly intelligent and dignified creatures
with a great respect for - and interest in - culture. In Salimarian
culture, being well-dressed is an absolute must, as it is symbolic
of their wealth and stature. Their skin is glossy black and smooth
with patches from their head to their tail that range from snow
white, to silver, to dark grey.
On average, Salimar stand roughly 4 and one-half feet tall; they have elongated bodies with somewhat stumpy legs and thick tails. It is widely known that Salimar are not only immune to fire, but are actually healed by it.
