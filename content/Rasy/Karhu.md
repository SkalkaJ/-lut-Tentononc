Karhu are intelligent and lumbering bears who wander the
world having all manner of adventures. There are three types
of Karhu: the agile, but smaller black Karhu; the strong and
powerful brown Karhu; and the rare, but majestic polar Karhu,.
The Karhu have a reputation for being calm and pensive but
terrifying when provoked or angered.
Karhu can walk on all fours or stand upright like the other
Heritages. They tend to wield no weapons (even though
they can), but often can be found using armor.
Magic among them is exceptionally rare.
They are roughly the same size as
mundane bears of the same type.
